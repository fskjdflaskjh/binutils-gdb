/* A note on memory usage for this file.
   
   At the present time, this code reads the debug info sections into
   the objfile's objfile_obstack.  A definite improvement for startup
   time, on platforms which do not emit relocations for debug
   sections, would be to use mmap instead.  The object's complete
   debug information is loaded into memory, partly to simplify
   absolute DIE references.

   Whether using obstacks or mmap, the sections should remain loaded
   until the objfile is released, and pointers into the section data
   can be used for any other data associated to the objfile (symbol
   names, type names, location expressions to name a few).  */

/* Read the initial length from a section.  The (draft) DWARF 3
   specification allows the initial length to take up either 4 bytes
   or 12 bytes.  If the first 4 bytes are 0xffffffff, then the next 8
   bytes describe the length and all offsets will be 8 bytes in length
   instead of 4.

   An older, non-standard 64-bit format is also handled by this
   function.  The older format in question stores the initial length
   as an 8-byte quantity without an escape value.  Lengths greater
   than 2^32 aren't very common which means that the initial 4 bytes
   is almost always zero.  Since a length value of zero doesn't make
   sense for the 32-bit format, this initial zero can be considered to
   be an escape value which indicates the presence of the older 64-bit
   format.  As written, the code can't detect (old format) lengths
   greater than 4GB.  If it becomes necessary to handle lengths somewhat
   larger than 4GB, we could allow other small values (such as the
   non-sensical values of 1, 2, and 3) to also be used as escape values
   indicating the presence of the old format.

   The value returned via bytes_read should be used to increment
   the relevant pointer after calling read_initial_length().
   
   As a side effect, this function sets the fields initial_length_size
   and offset_size in cu_header to the values appropriate for the
   length field.  (The format of the initial length field determines
   the width of file offsets to be fetched later with fetch_offset().)
   
   [ Note:  read_initial_length() and read_offset() are based on the
     document entitled "DWARF Debugging Information Format", revision
     3, draft 8, dated November 19, 2001.  This document was obtained
     from:

	http://reality.sgiweb.org/davea/dwarf3-draft8-011125.pdf
     
     This document is only a draft and is subject to change.  (So beware.)

     Details regarding the older, non-standard 64-bit format were
     determined empirically by examining 64-bit ELF files produced
     by the SGI toolchain on an IRIX 6.5 machine.

   now: for the address of static or global variables (partial symbols
   only) and for offsets into structures which are expected to be
   (more or less) constant.  The partial symbol case should go away,
   and only the constant case should remain.  That will let this
   function complain more accurately.  A few special modes are allowed
   without complaint for global variables (for instance, global
   register values and thread-local values).

   A location description containing no operations indicates that the
   object is optimized out.  The return value is 0 for that case.
   FIXME drow/2003-11-16: No callers check for this case any more; soon all
   callers will only want a very basic result and this can become a
   complaint.

   When the result is a register number, the global isreg flag is set,
   otherwise it is cleared.
